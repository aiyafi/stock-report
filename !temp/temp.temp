       SELECT DISTINCT id_outlet
       FROM jadwal_shift
       WHERE id_outlet IS NOT NULL  -- Exclude any null entries
       ORDER BY id_outlet ASC;  -- Sort alphabetically for UI friendliness
       ```
       - **What It Returns**: A list of unique outlet IDs, e.g., ["OUT-AUWXFVYRPA", "OUT-DLB6XFJQBK", "OUT-GCNV7MW5YK", "OUT-I0KWK8GSNN", "OUT-LMZ5JXV9WH", "OUT-UP6VLASEJX"].
       - **Alternative**: If you want outlets tied to specific time slots, query `jam_shift` instead: `SELECT DISTINCT id_outlet FROM jam_shift WHERE id_outlet IS NOT NULL;`. This might be useful if your "Outlet Option" page focuses on shift times.

     - **Laravel Eloquent Version** (for your app's backend):
       ```php
       // In a controller or model, e.g., JadwalShift model
       $outlets = JadwalShift::distinct()->pluck('id_outlet')->filter()->sort()->values();
       // Or for jam_shift: $outlets = JamShift::distinct()->pluck('id_outlet')->filter()->sort()->values();
       ```
       - **How to Use**: This fetches an array of outlet IDs. Pass it to your frontend (e.g., via Inertia.js) to populate a dropdown.

   - **Handling Display and Mapping**:
     - **Challenge**: The IDs (e.g., "OUT-I0KWK8GSNN") aren't descriptive. If you need readable names (e.g., "Main Outlet" or "Branch A"), consider:
       - **Manual Mapping**: Create a PHP array or config file in Laravel to map IDs to names (e.g., `$outletNames = ['OUT-I0KWK8GSNN' => 'Central Branch'];`).
       - **Dynamic Labels**: If outlet names are stored elsewhere (not in this dump), extend the query to join with a hypothetical `outlets` table. For now, display the IDs with a prefix like "Outlet: OUT-I0KWK8GSNN".
     - **Example Mapping Snippet**:
       ```php
       $outletNames = [
           'OUT-I0KWK8GSNN' => 'Central Branch',
           'OUT-GCNV7MW5YK' => 'North Branch',
           // Add more based on your DB data
       ];
       $outlets = JadwalShift::distinct()->pluck('id_outlet')->map(function ($id) use ($outletNames) {
           return ['id' => $id, 'name' => $outletNames[$id] ?? "Outlet: $id"];
       });
       ```

### 3. **Practical Examples from the DB Dump**
   To illustrate, here are real `id_outlet` examples from `jadwal_shift` (focusing on distinct values for your "Outlet Option" list). I scanned the dump for unique entries:
   
   - **Common Outlets from `jadwal_shift`** (Top Unique IDs):
     - "OUT-UP6VLASEJX" (e.g., Rows 2-5, 8, 10, 243, 249, 251, 256-267, 624-625) – Appears in many early shifts, often for "BARISTA" types.
     - "OUT-AUWXFVYRPA" (e.g., Rows 26-32, 41-52, 304-325, 426-429) – Tied to "KITCHEN" shifts, with dates like 2024-12-16.
     - "OUT-GCNV7MW5YK" (e.g., Rows 61-76, 87-98, 268-279, 292-303, 533-546) – Frequent in later sections, linked to various job types and recent dates (e.g., 2025-05-13).
     - "OUT-I0KWK8GSNN" (e.g., Rows 114-154, 326-337, 350-361, 589-598) – Common for "BARISTA" and "KITCHEN" shifts, with tasks in some rows (e.g., Row 299).
     - "OUT-DLB6XFJQBK" (e.g., Rows 722-728, 1070-1077, 1103-1111) – Appears in payroll-related periods, often for specific job types like "KITCHEN".
     - "OUT-LMZ5JXV9WH" (e.g., Rows 1050-1051, 1058-1061, 1092-1095) – More recent entries (e.g., 2025-09-19), tied to "BARISTA" and "KITCHEN".
     - "OUT-B79GONHVSP" (e.g., Rows 1053, 1080-1083, 1177-1181) – Linked to specific job types like "KITCHEN".
     - "OUT-FVMEXEIVJV" (e.g., Rows 1054-1055, 1084-1091, 1192-1221) – Recent shifts (e.g., 2025-09-19) for "KITCHEN" and "BARISTA".
     
     **How to Use in Your "Outlet Option" Page**: Populate a dropdown with these IDs. For example, if a user selects "OUT-I0KWK8GSNN", your app could then filter `jadwal_shift` for shifts at that outlet (e.g., to show today's schedule). This ensures the options are dynamic and based on real DB data.

   - **Tying to Time/Shifts**: If your page needs to show outlets with active time slots, query `jam_shift` for the same `id_outlet` values. Example: Outlet "OUT-DLB6XFJQBK" has shifts like ID 1 (10:00-15:00) and ID 2 (14:00-19:00).

### 4. **Integrating into Your App's "First Page"**
   - **Assumed Context**: Based on your recently viewed files (e.g., `Welcome.jsx`), this might be the entry point where users select an outlet before viewing reports or shifts. Use the query above to fetch outlets and render them in a React component.
   
   - **Frontend Implementation (React/JSX)**:
     - **Fetch Data**: In your Laravel controller (e.g., `WelcomeController`), run the query and pass to the view:
       ```php
       public function index() {
           $outlets = JadwalShift::distinct()->pluck('id_outlet')->filter()->sort()->values();
           return Inertia::render('Welcome', ['outlets' => $outlets]);
       }
       ```
     - **Render in JSX** (e.g., in `resources/js/Pages/Welcome.jsx`):
       ```jsx
       import { usePage } from '@inertiajs/react';

       function Welcome() {
           const { outlets } = usePage().props;

           return (
               <div>
                   <h1>Outlet Options</h1>
                   <select>
                       <option value="">Select an Outlet</option>
                       {outlets.map((outlet) => (
                           <option key={outlet} value={outlet}>
                               {outlet} {/* Or map to a name if you add labels */}
                           </option>
                       ))}
                   </select>
                   {/* Add logic to handle selection, e.g., navigate to a report page */}
               </div>
           );
       }
       ```
       - **Enhancements**: Add onChange to store the selected outlet (e.g., in state) and use it for subsequent queries (e.g., filtering today's shifts).

   - **Best Practices**:
     - **Dynamic and Accurate**: Querying `jadwal_shift` ensures your options update if new outlets are added to the DB (e.g., via admin actions).
     - **Edge Cases**: Handle empty results (e.g., "No outlets available") or invalid IDs. Validate selections to prevent errors.
     - **Performance**: With 1224+ rows in `jadwal_shift`, the `DISTINCT` query is efficient, but cache results if the page loads frequently.
     - **Security**: Use your `CheckRole` middleware here too—e.g., restrict outlet access based on user roles if some outlets are sensitive.
     - **UI Polish**: Style the dropdown with Tailwind (already in your setup) for a clean look.

This should directly address how to pull outlet data from the DB for your "Outlet Option" page. If your "first page" is specifically `Welcome.jsx` or another file, and you want to refine the query (e.g., filter by active outlets only), share more details—I can provide tailored examples! For applying this in code or testing queries, switch to "agent mode."
