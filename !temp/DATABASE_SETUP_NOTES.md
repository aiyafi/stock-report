# Database Setup - Fixed Issues

## Problem
The application was trying to access database tables that didn't exist in the MySQL database `u661459317_shifting`.

## Tables Created
The following tables were added to support Laravel's functionality:

### 1. **sessions** table
- Stores user session data (required when `SESSION_DRIVER=database`)
- Columns: id, user_id, ip_address, user_agent, payload, last_activity

### 2. **cache** table  
- Stores cached data (required when `CACHE_STORE=database`)
- Columns: key, value, expiration

### 3. **cache_locks** table
- Manages cache locks for concurrent requests
- Columns: key, owner, expiration

### 4. **jobs** table
- Stores queued jobs (required when `QUEUE_CONNECTION=database`)
- Columns: id, queue, payload, attempts, reserved_at, available_at, created_at

### 5. **job_batches** table
- Manages job batches
- Columns: id, name, total_jobs, pending_jobs, failed_jobs, failed_job_ids, options, cancelled_at, created_at, finished_at

## Current Database Configuration (.env)
```
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=u661459317_shifting
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=

SESSION_DRIVER=database
CACHE_STORE=database
QUEUE_CONNECTION=database
```

## Existing Tables (from SQL import)
The database already contains these tables from your imported SQL file:
- users (with role, username, email, etc.)
- jadwal_shift
- jam_shift
- kesediaan
- migrations
- password_resets
- periode_gaji
- tipe_pekerjaan
- failed_jobs

## Migration Status
The Laravel migrations are marked as "Pending" because the tables were created directly via SQL.
This is fine - the database structure is complete and functional.

## âœ… Application Status
**The application is now fully functional!**

You can now:
- Access the homepage at http://127.0.0.1:8000
- Login with existing users (Manager or Staff roles)
- Use the stock reporting feature
- Dashboard is restricted to Manager role only

## Test Credentials (from your database)
- **Manager:** manager@gmail.com
- **Staff:** staff@gmail.com
- Check your SQL file for passwords (they're hashed, so you may need to reset them)
